    "**Because Python syntax allowed for only a single multiplication operator `*`, libraries providing array-like objects\n",
    "must decide: either use `*` for elementwise multiplication, or use `*` for matrix multiplication**. Unfortunately, it turns out that when doing general-purpose number crunching, both operations are used frequently! So it's not clear in which of the two cases the infix should be preferred to the function call syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This leads to a lot of mixups, since some number crunching libraries followed one convention and some another. Or the same library can switch convention when dealing with different objects (what!?).** Exactly. For `numpy.ndarray` objects (now [deprecated](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.matrix.html), to be fair), `*` performs elementwise multiplication, and matrix multiplication must use a function call (`numpy.matmul`). For `numpy.matrix` objects, `*` performs matrix multiplication, and elementwise multiplication requires function syntax. Can be something more evil than that?\n",
