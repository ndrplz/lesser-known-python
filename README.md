# lesser-known-python
Collection of lesser-known python features that you will love (and use).

**I code in Python a lot, and from time to time I learn something new that makes me exclaim "*Wow! That's cool! I wonder how I didn't know that before!*". The goal of this repository is to collect these kind of discoveries.**

Although the features collected here may not be widely known, they are supposed to be potentially useful in your day-to-day work (and mine too!). The goal is *not* to collect tricks or surprising behaviors that make you ask yourself "WTF is going on here?". If this is what you were looking for this is not the right place, but I can recommend you to spend some time on the amazing [wtfpython](https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython) repository.

## FAQ
* **I know this hidden gem, but it's not mentioned here!**
    
    Let's add it then! Feel free open an [issue](https://github.com/ndrplz/lesser-known-python/issues) or make a pull request.
    
* **The thing *x* that you wrote is wrong.**

    Thank you for noticing! Although I do my best, I can make mistakes. That's how we learning works. Feel free open an [issue](https://github.com/ndrplz/lesser-known-python/issues) and I'll fix it.
    
* **Why are you doing this?**

  A number of reasons! First (very selfishly) I wanted to write down some cools things that I learnt during the last years. Second, I have a lot of fun learning new things and teaching is the best way to learn. Then, since I learnt a lot of things on the web, I'm glad if I give something back too!
