# lesser-known-python
Collection of lesser-known python features that you will love (and use).

**I code in Python a lot, and from time to time I learn something new that makes me exclaim "*Wow! That's cool! I wonder how I didn't know that before!*". The goal of this repository is to collect these kind of discoveries.**

Although the features collected here may not be widely known, they are supposed to be potentially useful in your day-to-day work (and mine too!). The goal is *not* to collect tricks or surprising behaviors that make you ask yourself "WTF is going on here?". If this is what you were looking for this is not the right place, but I can recommend you the amazing [wtfpython](https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython) repository.
